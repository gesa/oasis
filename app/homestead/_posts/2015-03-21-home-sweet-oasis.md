It’s not actually an oasis. Not really. But it’s in the desert as well as a
floodplain, with a lush meadow and a seasonal creek, so close enough. I love it:
it is home; it is a realization of a dream; it is the future.

Have you ever worked toward a dream for so long that, once you get what you came
for, you have a hard time believing what you have is true? We spent the entire
closing process just waiting for the other shoe to fall (and to be fair maybe we
still are waiting for that shoe). We extended contingency so we could do due
diligence, make sure we weren’t totally screwed on building a home here once it
was all said and done. After the land, based on **our** understanding of the
process, was legally ours, there turned out to be a problem at the title
company. (At 4:30pm on a Friday! jerks.) We held out hope, but, while I can’t
speak for my partner, deep in my gut I assumed it was over. We were so used to
this search for the perfect plot of land that I just assumed it was back to
that.

28 acres is a lot bigger than I thought it was. Like, a lot. Hell, the 18-ish
that are useable (by a standard definition—the back 10 is great for hiking) seem
like way more than that. Maybe it’s the landscape—maybe it wouldn’t feel so big
if it was flat farmland. But it couldn’t be farther from the standard Kansas
cornfield. It’s a canyon, and foothills, and a meadow, and boulders the size of
Volkswagens. (so many VW boulders. so, so many.)

This ground we stand on has a history. Before there was any Oregon Trail shit
going on, there were nomadic native people who passed through regularly. (OKAY
LOOK I know this is CA and not OR but the analogy works.) Well over 100 years
ago, it was a homestead… and by “homestead,” I mean some enterprising person
claimed the **entire canyon** for their own. In retrospect, the homesteading
act(s) may have been a *bit* permissive. Regardless, over the following century,
the acreage slowly was carved away into the lots my neighbors own now. What
remains is 28 acres and a tiny stone shack.

Thanks in no small part to the history of this land, there is work to do that
could easily take into our 80’s to get completely done. A wholly incomplete list
of sample projects:

- Deal with the barn that burned down at some point, leaving charred boards to be cleared away.
- Clear away the ancient irrigation system that appears to cover the entire meadow with buried, rusted, possibly lead, pipes.
- Remove the once-goat pen, with its now-buried barbed wire and rusted feed bins.
- Try to figure out what to do about the three mysterious building foundations we’ve found scattered about.
- Clear the asphalt that someone poured once upon a time, directly on top of dirt. That lasted long I’m sure.
- Collect and recycle all the PVC piping and metal drums the neighbors used for target practice with their BB guns when they were teenagers.
- Empty the creek bed of foliage so the water can actually flow, assuming it EVER RAINS AGAIN.
- Maybe some day build an outdoor kitchen inside the original homestead, because not using it would be a crime against history (or future history maybe?)

It’s going to be hard, which is maybe the best part. I spend 40+ hours a week
sitting or standing at a desk. I don’t go to the gym for all sorts of reasons. I
went from being a startlingly strong gymnast to being a blob in a desk chair in
the fastest decade of human history. Or maybe it just feels like the fastest
decade to me. Either way, this work is good for my body. It’s good for my mind.
When I’m on a roll going to the gym on a regular basis, sometimes my muscles
feel tired, but it’s meaningless. It was running on a treadmill while watching
Maddow (no offense Maddow).

When my muscles feel tired here, it is because I *accomplished* something. Today
I dug a couple of holes so we could install some solar motion lights. I cleaned
up some garbage around the homestead house. I cleared a bunch of asphalt from
where we park the Jeep. We filled the 35-gallon water tank, which was MUCH
HARDER than either of us expected it to be. As I type this, I am sore, and
tired, and shocked that it’s only 9:20pm. Also? I am happy.

This is only weekend two, and we already have stories of neighbors helping
neighbors, stories of small victories, and stories of “fail”, minor and up.

Can’t wait to see what the next 50 years have in store.
